5,Why is n-hexane : ethyl acetate (8.5 : 1.5) used as the mobile phase in thin layer chromatography?,"
The mobile phase is used to separate the components of the mixture. The mixture is applied to a thin layer of silica gel on a glass plate. The plate is placed in a jar containing the mobile phase. The mobile phase moves up the plate by capillary action. The components of the mixture are carried up the plate at different rates depending on their solubility in the mobile phase. The more soluble components move faster and are carried further up the plate. The less soluble components move more slowly and are carried less far up the plate. The components of the mixture can be identified by their position on the plate. The more soluble components are closer to the top of the plate and the less soluble components are closer to the bottom of the plate.","['(L¡kÀ¡).\nThin layer chromatography:\nExtract 5 g of formulation powder in 75 ml of n- hexane under reflux on a water-bath for 30 min.
