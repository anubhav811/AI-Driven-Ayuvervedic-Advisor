This solution is boiled over a  \nmoderate fire. When pressed between two fingers if P¡ka becomes thready (Tantuvat), or when it sinks in water without getting easily dissolved,  \nit should be removed from the fire. Fine powders of drugs are then added in small quantities and stirred continuously to form a homogenous  \nmixture. Ghee or oil, if mentioned, is added while the preparation is still hot and mixed well. Honey, if mentioned is added when the preparation  \nbecomes cool and mixed well.\nThe Lehya should neither be hard nor a thick fluid.
