5,Why is n-hexane : ethyl acetate (8.5 : 1.5) used as the mobile phase in thin layer chromatography?,"
The choice of mobile phase in thin layer chromatography depends on the properties of the compounds being separated. In this case, n-hexane : ethyl acetate (8.5 : 1.5) was used as the mobile phase because it is expected to provide good separation of the components in the formulation powder. The exact reason for this specific composition of the mobile phase is not clear from the given context, but it may have been optimized through experimentation to achieve the best separation of the compounds.

In general, n-hexane is a relatively nonpolar solvent that is often used to separate nonpolar compounds, while ethyl acetate is a more polar solvent that can help separate compounds with intermediate polarity. By adjusting the ratio of these two solvents, it is possible to create a mobile phase that is effective for separating a wide range of compounds. In this case, the 8.5 : 1.5 ratio was chosen, but other ratios could also be used depending on the specific separation goals.

It's also worth noting that the mobile phase used in thin layer chromatography can affect the detection of compounds on the plate. In this case, the plate was examined under ultraviolet light, which can be more effective for detecting certain types of compounds in certain mobile phases. The specific wavelength of ultraviolet light used (366 nm) may also be important for detecting certain compounds.","['(L¡kÀ¡).\nThin layer chromatography:\nExtract 5 g of formulation powder in 75 ml of n- hexane under reflux on a water-bath for 30 min.

6,"What are the recommended daily dosage and substance taken with Cyavanaprāśa for therapeutic uses, and what are the percentages of total sugar, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars, and pH of the aqueous solution?","

The recommended daily dosage of Cyavanaprāśa for therapeutic uses is 3 g, divided into doses. The substances taken with Cyavanaprāśa are Mudga YuÀa (Roasted Rice), Milk, and Sugandhijala (Sweet Scented Clay).

Unfortunately, the text does not provide information on the percentages of total sugar, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars, and pH of the aqueous solution of Cyavanaprāśa.","['IMPORTANT FORMULATIONS  -  Cyavanapr¡¿a. \n \nTHERAPEUTIC USES  -  Raktapitta; Amlapitta; Prameha; D¡ha \nDOSE  -  10-20 g of the drug.\n    5-10 ml of fresh juice. \n   \n  \n6'

7,"What are the stages in the P¡ka process for Taila and Gh¤ta, and how do they differ in application?"," The P¡ka process for Taila and Gh¤ta involves boiling the ingredients on a mild to moderate flame until the moisture evaporates and the characteristic features of the final product appear. However, the number of stages and their specifications can differ.

For Taila, the process is typically divided into three stages: M¤du P¡ka, Usna P¡ka, and Maraka P¡ka. In the first stage, M¤du P¡ka, the contents look waxy and can be rolled between fingers. In the second stage, Usna P¡ka, the contents become liquid and frothy. In the third stage, Maraka P¡ka, the contents are boiled until they form a thin layer on the surface, indicating that all the moisture has evaporated.

Gh¤ta, on the other hand, may undergo a different number of stages depending on the specific recipe and therapeutic purposes. The main difference is that Gh¤ta is not stirred continuously like Taila, and it is allowed to settle and cool between stages. This results in a more granular texture and a distinct layer separation, which is a characteristic feature of Gh¤ta.

In terms of application, Taila is typically used for external applications, such as massage oils or topical treatments, due to its smooth and liquid consistency. Gh¤ta, on the other hand, is often used for internal applications, such as medicinal decoctions or as a base for other Ayurvedic preparations, due to its granular texture and distinct layer separation.","['continuously through out the process in order to avoid charring.\n6.The process of boiling is to be continued till the whole amount of moisture gets evaporated  \nand characteristic features of Taila appears.\n7.The whole process of P¡ka should be carried out on a mild to moderate flame. \n8.Three stages of P¡ka are specified for therapeutic purposes .\na.M¤du P¡ka: In this stage, the Kalka looks waxy and when rolled between fingers, it'
