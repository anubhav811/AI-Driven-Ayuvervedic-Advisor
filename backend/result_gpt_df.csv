5,Why is n-hexane : ethyl acetate (8.5 : 1.5) used as the mobile phase in thin layer chromatography?,"The choice of n-hexane : ethyl acetate (8.5 : 1.5) as the mobile phase in thin layer chromatography is based on the solubility and separation characteristics of the compounds being analyzed. This particular mobile phase ratio is selected because it provides a suitable polarity and elution strength to separate the components in the formulation powder effectively. The n-hexane component is non-polar, while ethyl acetate is a slightly polar solvent. By using a mixture of these two solvents in a specific ratio, a good separation of the compounds can be achieved on the TLC plate. However, it's important to note that the choice of mobile phase can vary depending on the specific compounds being analyzed and the desired separation.","['(L¡kÀ¡).\nThin layer chromatography:\nExtract 5 g of formulation powder in 75 ml of n- hexane under reflux on a water-bath for 30 min.
