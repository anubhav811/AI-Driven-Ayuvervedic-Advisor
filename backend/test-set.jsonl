Preparations having the exudates as main effective  \ningredient are known as  Guggulu. There are five different varieties of Guggulu described in the Ayurvedic texts. However two of the varieties,  \nnamely,  Mahi\u00c0\u00a1k\u00c0a  and  Kanaka Guggulu are usually preferred for medicinal preparations.  Mahi\u00c0\u00a1k\u00c0a Guggulu  is dark greenish brown and  \nKanaka Guggulu is yellowish brown in color.\nBefore using, Guggulu is cleaned in the following manner:\n1.Sand, stone, plant debris, glass etc. are first removed.\n2.It is then broken into small pieces.\n3.It is thereafter bundled in a piece of cloth and boiled in Dol\u00a1 Yantra  containing  \n      any one of the following fluids.\na.Gom\u00a3tra,\nb.Triphal\u00a1 ka\u00c0\u00a1ya.,\nc.Nirgu\u00b8\u00b7\u00a2 patra Svarasa with Haridr\u00a1 C\u00a3r\u00b8a , \nd.V\u00a1s\u00a1patra Ka\u00c0\u00a1ya,\ne.V\u00a1s\u00a1patra Svarasa and\nf.Dugdha.\nThe boiling of Guggulu in  Dol\u00a1 Yantra  is carried on until all the Guggulu passes into the fluid through the cloth.
